# Simple Java Console Application Using a Directed Graph Structure
# Introduction 
This application is a simple Java console program that uses a directed graph data structure. A directed graph is a way to represent connections between items where the connections have a direction. For example, if you have a graph of websites, a directed edge from one website to another means that there is a link from the first website to the second. This program allows users to add nodes (points) and directed edges (connections) between them.

# What It Can Do
Add Nodes: Users can add points (nodes) to the graph.
Add Directed Edges: Users can create directed connections (edges) from one node to another.
Display the Graph: Users can see the current state of the graph, showing all nodes and their directed connections

# Why This Application Was Made
This application was created to help users understand how directed graphs work. Directed graphs are used in many real-world applications, such as web page linking, social media connections, and more. By using this program, users can learn about directed graphs in a simple and interactive way. This knowledge can be useful for students and anyone interested in programming

# Contribution to You and the Community
This application helps with learning and education. It allows users to practice their programming skills and understand important concepts in computer science. By providing a hands-on way to explore directed graphs, it can make learning more engaging and effective. This can benefit students, teachers, and anyone who wants to improve their coding skills.
